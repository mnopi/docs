## [Tap/Bottles to GitHub releases](https://brew.sh/2020/11/18/homebrew-tap-with-bottles-uploaded-to-github-releases/)

### Create a GitHub repository, i.e., `critic` `hombrew-critic`

```bash
brew tap-new j5pu/critic
cd $(brew --repository j5pu/critic)
git remote add origin https://github.com/j5pu/homebrew-critic
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

Two workflow files created by default, see also 
[yandex-go](https://github.com/msoap/yandex-weather-cli/blob/master/.github/workflows/go.yml), 
[yandex-rebase](https://github.com/msoap/yandex-weather-cli/tree/master/.github/workflows),
[tap-release](https://github.com/apps/tap-release) and [GitVersion](https://gitversion.net/docs/usage/) 
for automatic version:
1.  `tests.yml`: run on each pull_request event, so every push to a PRâ€™s branch triggers the workflow,
which tests changes made to formulae, 
builds bottles for those formulae and uploads them to GitHub Actions as artifacts.
2. `publish.yml`: run when a pull request is labelled, 
is responsible for bottle uploading and publishing.

### Creating formula, edit, audit and test.
All formulae should go in the `Formula` directory.

````bash
https://github.com/psampaz/gothanks/archive/v0.3.0.tar.gz
url="https://github.com/j5pu/critic/archive/refs/tags/v0.1.0.tar.gz"
brew create --tap=j5pu/critic "${url/ref\/tags\//}"  # creates a Formula/critic.rb
````

* Edit: `brew edit j5pu/critic/critic`
* Audit: `brew audit --quiet --new critic`
* Test: `/usr/local/bin/brew install --quiet j5pu/critic/critic; brew test --quiet critic`

### Branch, add formula, commit and push.
````bash
git checkout -b fork
git add Formula/critic.rb
git commit --message "critic 0.1.0 (new formula)"
git push --set-upstream origin fork
````

### Trigger workflows.
To trigger the workflows, created a pull request.

```bash
gh loguser  # gh auth login --with-token <<< $GITHUB_USER_TOKEN
gh prfill  # gh pr create --fill --label pr_pull
```

## Tips

### Depends
```ruby
depends_on "bash"
depends_on "go" => :build
depends_on "cmake" => :build
```
### Install with different name

````ruby
def install
  bin.install "critic.sh" => "critic"
end
````

### System Command with args

````ruby
def install 
  # https://rubydoc.brew.sh/Formula.html#std_configure_args-instance_method
  system "./configure", *std_configure_args, "--disable-silent-rules"
end
````

### Test

```ruby
test do 
    # `test do` will create, run in and delete a temporary directory. 
    # 
    # This test will fail and we won't accept that! For Homebrew/homebrew-core 
    # this will need to be a test that verifies the functionality of the 
    # software. Run the test with `brew test critic`. Options passed 
    # to `brew install` such as `--HEAD` also need to be provided to `brew test`. 
    # 
  system "true"
end
```

```ruby
test do
    ENV.delete "GITHUB_TOKEN"
    assert_match "no Github token found", shell_output(bin/"gothanks", 255)
end
```
